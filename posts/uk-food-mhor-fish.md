>Fish and chips flagship store - It is no doubt a fish and chips restaurant. There are a variety of fish selections including cod, haddock, monkfish etc. The fish can also be pan fried instead of traditional deep fried. My fish was very crispy on the outside and tender and fresh inside. I also had a soup of the day which is very hearty. The only thing I would moan about is that the chocolate milkshake was a bit too sweet.
