>The restaurant was in very quintessential Tudor style with low ceiling and exposed beams. The seats were covered with sheep fur. I ordered scallop as starter and cod as main. The scallop was cooked just right with a fresh herbal flavour. The cod was served with barley rice and mushroom, which conveys a very interesting combination of tastes. Good restaurant. Recommended.
