>Combining British heritage with European grandeur, ‘Piccadilly’s Shining Pearl’ (as the building became known during its time as a bank), now opened its doors as what was considered to be London’s first Grand Café. Renowned today for its spectacular interior, classic food and seamless service, The Wolseley has earned its reputation as one of London’s most respected all-day café-restaurants, becoming an iconic institution the world over.

>它的明星单品非榛果拿铁和蜂蜜蛋糕莫属。拿铁的坚果香、咖啡香和奶香都朴实而浓郁。蜂蜜蛋糕之于我，好像是温柔版的千层酥。它的外表那么朴素，味道却这样的惊艳。一层蜂蜜蛋糕一层奶油，如此反复多次的结合，竟是这样的香甜柔滑，温暖人心！

>伦敦的soho地区有许多巷弄里的美食，其中有一间咖啡馆独特、活泼又美味，不论是朋友小聚、午间小憩还是情侣约会，都非常合适。
